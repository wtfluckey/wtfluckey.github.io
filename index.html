    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>I started my career in software development when I moved from Des Moines, Iowa to Columbus, Ohio in early 2012 to become a COBOL developer for Nationwide Insurance. After 6 months at Nationwide, I learned a bit about a lot of different technologies, including .NET, Ruby Automation with Cucumber, and SQL. I liked Ruby and started teaching myself on the side, and soon after took an Intro to Programming in Ruby class with GDI and met many amazing people in the Ruby community and was hooked. I found out about an apprenticeship opening at a local Ruby on Rails consultancy, Neo Innovation, and applied. They took me in and taught me the ways of Ruby and Rails and I was hired on as a full-time developer in May of 2013. Since that time, I have worked with many different types of clients, from enterprises to startups, all in an agile and lean environment. I have been a part of almost every stage of software development from client interviews and requirements gathering (I love it!), to backend development, to creating high-res design mockups and turning them into code. I'm a very creative and empathetic individual who is eager and quick to learn new things.</p>
