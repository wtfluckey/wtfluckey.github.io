        <p>I am a front-end developer/designer looking for a new gig! I live in Columbus, Ohio and grew up near Des Moines, Iowa. I'm a creative, intuitive and empathetic person who craves a meaningful existence. I am always improving and I try to live my life without fear. My hobbies include traveling, painting (oil and acrylic), glass blowing, and seeing my favorite bands live. I may have a small obsession with lava lamps.</p>

        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>I started my career in software development when I moved from Des Moines, Iowa to Columbus, Ohio in early 2012 to become a 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> developer for Nationwide Insurance. After 6 months at Nationwide, I learned a bit about a lot of different technologies, 
        including .NET, Ruby Automation with Cucumber, and SQL. I liked Ruby and started teaching myself on the side, and soon after took an 
        Intro to Programming in Ruby class with <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/columbus">Girl Develop It</a> and met many amazing people in the Ruby community and was hooked. 
        I found out about an apprenticeship opening at a local Ruby on Rails consultancy, <a href="http://www.neo.com/">Neo Innovation</a>, 
        and applied. They took me in and taught me the ways of Ruby and Rails and I was hired on as a full-time developer in May of 2013. 
        Since that time, I have worked with many different types of clients, from enterprises to startups, all in an agile and lean environment. 
        I have been a part of almost every stage of software development from client interviews and requirements gathering (I love it!), to backend development, 
        to creating high-res design mockups and turning them into code. </p>
